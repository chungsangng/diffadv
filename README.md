Diffusion-advection model

Here are the files for the code and outputs for the results published in Ng, C. S., Neupane, B. R., Delamere, P.
A., & Damiano, P. A. (2022). A turbulent
heating model combining diffusion
and advection effects for giant planet
magnetospheres. Geophysical Research
Letters, 49, e2021GL096662. https://doi.org/10.1029/2021GL096662.

The file adv-diff.f is the fortran code that generates the outputs. The description of the equations can be found in the publication.
Input parameters are listed in the beginning of each output file. 
The output file adv-diff-JS.oa6.txt is for the Jupiter case.
The output files adv-diff-S.oa2.txt, adv-diff-S.oa3.txt, and adv-diff-S.oa4.txt are for the Saturn cases with mdot = 30, 50, 80 kg/s respectively.
